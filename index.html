							<h1 > The reasons for Zoos</h1>
							<p><img src="Images/animal taken care.jpg" alt="animal_caring" class="care"> Across the American landscape, there are numerous places to go and things to do with your free time. There are places that are set in nature, such as National Parks, Places on the National Register of Historic Place, or even a simple fishing trip of Whale Watching. There are also man-made attractions, such as amusement parks, bowling, the movies, and even restaurants. However, there is one place that combines both the naturals experience and the comfort of something man made, and that would be the zoo!</p>

				<p><img src="Images/-safari-park-little-girl-watching.jpg" alt="safari_girl" class="safari"> I love going to the zoo! The zoo is always comfortable for walking and has both inside and outside attractions. The best thing about the zoo is of course the animals! I like to see all the animals that I could never see safely in the wild. Animals sometimes are afraid of humans and can be dangerous. At the zoo, they are always safely behind glass or an enclosure letting them be in the natural state. I even feel safe visiting the monkeys, who in my country chased me down flights of stairs and had me running scared! Thankfully that is something I do not have to worry about in the zoo!<br></p>
<p><img src="Images/tiger_reflection_2.jpg" alt="tiger reflect" class="tiger_reflect"> The zoo is also very educational. I like learning about animals from other parts of the world. The have classes and information sessions about each of the animals during different parts of the day. The animalâ€™s handlers are very knowledgeable and clearly love what they do and care for the animals. I like learning about what they eat, how they mate and live in their environment.<br>
</p>
			
<p class="rachel3"> For the Animals</p>
				
<p><img src="Images/tigerdie-1024x536.jpg" alt="tiger die" class="tigerdie">A lot of people say that the zoo is bad for the animals as they are locked in cages, but that is not true at all! Zoos are great for the animals as they are just as safe as we are. They never have to worry and be scared about hunters or other predators. Even the predators get to be lazy and are fed lots of raw meat every day.</p>
<p>The zoo is also the leader in animal replenishment, Animals that are low in numbers in the wild and close to extinction are brought to the zoo to find prime mating conditions to bring their species back to populous numbers. The research going on at the zoo will help the animals come back stronger than before and be released into the wild so they can be at their natural state.</p>
<p> I know not every zoo, safari or aquarium is perfect, but they all serve an important role in conservation, research and education for the animals that they care for. Please go visit the zoo today!</p>
